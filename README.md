## ATMPinValidator

A simple program to validate a unique four and six digit PINs with no same digits for an ATM. Ex. 1234, 123456, 12345678 are valid PINs but 1111, 111111, 12345678 are not valid PINs. Input= 1234, Output: Valid PIN. Input: 1111, Output: Invalid PIN. Input= 123456, Output: Valid PIN. Input= 122344, Output: Invalid PIN.

## CodeSnippets

A program to return appropriate exception messages for different scenarios whenever there is an exception. Ex. IndexOutOfRangeException, ArgumentNullException, NullReferenceException, NotImplementedException, OverflowException, etc. Input: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1/0, Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, DivideByZeroException.

## DataTypes

A program to demonstrate the difference between data types by returning the value of each data type. Ex. int, long, float, double etc. Input: int=-25, long=-100000L, d=-12.34, Output: 25, 100000, -12.34.

## DuplicateNumbers

A program to find the duplicate numbers in a given array of numbers.
Input: numbers = { 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 3, 5, 6, 6, 10, 10, 15, 15 }, Output: duplicateNumbers = { 3, 5, 6, 1, 15 }.

## LetterProcessor

A program to process the letters in a given string and return the number of letters in the string. A first letter should be capitalized for the words which are having more than three letters. Ex. Input = "this interview is for full stack developer with string", Output = "This Interview is for Full Stack Developer With String".

## Patterns

A random pattern matching program.

## PlusMinusNeutral

A program to return the positive numbers and negative numbers and a number 0 from a given array. Input: = Enter a list of integers horizontally separated by a blank space to differentiate these numbers into three categories of positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. Ex. Input: numbers = { - 1, -3, 4, 0, -2, 5, -1 }, Output:  Positive Numbers: { 1, 4, 5 }, Negative Numbers: { -3, -2, -1 }, Zero Numbers: { 0 }.

## RegularExpression

A simple program to validate time for a given string of date and time by replacing 01:00 AM with an alternate text related to the given time. Input: A given today's date 06/20/25 and current time is 02:09 PM with an Output: A given today's date 06/20/25 and current time is 02 hours and 09 minutes in the afternoon.

## SecondMostSorting

A simple program to find the second largest number in a given array of numbers. Ex. Input: numbers = { 7, 4, 10, 20, 5, 23, 44, 66, 22, 11 }, Output: a second most sorting number is 44.

## Sorting

A program to sort the given array of numbers in ascending order. Ex.
Input: numbers = { 42, 30, 12, 56, 89, 45, 37 }, Output: { 30, 42, 37, 45, 56, 89, 12 }.
